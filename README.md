# Spark SDK 
The Spark iOS SDK enables iOS apps to interact with Spark-powered connected products via the Spark Cloud.
Library will allow you to easily manage active user sessions to Spark cloud, query for device info,
read and write data to/from Spark Core/Photon devices and (via exposed variables and functions)
publish and subscribe events to/from the cloud or to/from devices (coming soon).

## How To Get Started
